# FatCow

Nostos is a web application created to support the sales of nutritional products for cattle from a Brazilian company. It facilitates data visualization of predictions and potential results for customers and organizes sales information for sales assistants.

## Idea

This application represents more than mere lines of code; it embodies a collaborative effort focused on supporting farmers.

Animal nutritionists, including my brother, commonly relied on Excel sheets for data presentation to farmers. Recognizing the need for a more engaging tool to showcase the true potential of offered products, we embarked on the development of FatCow. Our vision was clear: to revolutionize the tedious process of estimating and presenting data into an exciting, interactive experience.

This is what sets FatCow apart:

- ✨ Streamlined and practical interface
- ✨ Adaptable templating engine
- ✨ Effortless Data Visualization
